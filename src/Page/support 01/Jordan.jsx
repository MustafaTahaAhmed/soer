            Jordan's National Voluntary Review on the implementation of the 2030
            Agenda

          Jordan was one of the first countries to present a Voluntary National
          Review (VNR) of the national progress made in implementing the 2030
          Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) at the High-Level
          Political Forum (HLPF) in 2017. During the Forum, Jordan affirmed its
          commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda, and highlighted its role
          in seeking to achieve permanent peace, as an oasis of security and
          stability in a turbulent region. Jordan’s Second national voluntary
          report were submitted July.20203 . Future efforts will focus on two
          tracks as we move forward towards 2030: the first pertaining to the
          framework for the 2030 Agenda in Jordan, with work to be directed
          towards strengthening the institutional structure and capacities
          required for achieving the SDGs, in addition to continuing to develop
          the national SDGs database, to take into account sex, age and
          disability, while addressing some issues including the duplication of
          efforts that in some cases characterizes the work undertaken in

          <div className="secondplacer1">Jordan Environmental Governance</div>
          The Ministry of Environment (MoEnv) is the government's main authority
          on environmental issues. It has taken the lead in promoting
          legislative frameworks, designing strategies, formulating policies,
          and establishing regulatory standards for environmental protection and
          preservation activities, as well as increasing environmental
          monitoring and law enforcement. The ministry's efforts aid in the
          spread of environmental culture and the modification of individual and
          society behavior towards environmental issues in a way that leads to
          the preservation and protection of the environment4 . The ministry had
          many technical directorates from which; environmental monitoring and
          assessment, environmental licensing, Environmental Impact Assessment,
          Auditing and inspection, Waste and Hazardous waste and substances,
          Climate change, the chair of the National Climate Change Committee
          (NCCC), in addition and -among other functions- serves as a national
          focal point for all international and environmental conventions and
          protocols, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
          Change (UNFCCC)5 . In 2020, the Government of Jordan adopted the Waste
          Management Framework Law No. 16 for the year 2020, where this law was
          prepared by the ministry of environment in cooperation with all
          stakeholders to enhance the governance in waste management and
          determine the responsibilities for all authorities who are responsible
          for the all types of waste (Hazardous, domestic, commercial,
          agriculture, industrial, demolition and construction….etc.), in
          addition to the responsibilities of the producer and holder of large
          waste quantities and the operator of waste collection system serving
          them, and encouraging the involvement of the private sector through
          the investing in the waste management activities, and regulating the
          initiation on national EPR system. Additionally, on the environmental
          monitoring, Jordan has different constitutional provisions for
          controlling the air pollution:
          <ul>
            <li>The environmental protection law no. 6 of 2017;</li>
            <li>
              Air protection regulation no. 28 of 2005 Environmental Impact
              Assessment studies regulation no. 37 of 2005;
            </li>
            <li>The Environmental Audit Instruction of 2014;</li>
            <li>The International Agreements related to air pollution;</li>
            <li>Ambient Air Quality Jordanian Standards no 1140 of 2006;</li>
            <li>
              Maximum allowable limits of air pollutants emitted from the
              stationary sources.
            </li>
          </ul>
          These rules and regulations are reflecting specific examples for
          controlling environmental pollutants. The governmental challenge to
          address air pollution has been to expand the ambient air quality’s
          network monitoring. The Jordan Environment Fund (JEF) was established
          in 2009 under the Environment Protection Law (6/2017), with a mandate
          to help Jordan advance its national goals for environmental protection
          and sustainable development. JEF is governed by its own bylaw (No. 18
          for the year 2018) through its Board of Directors, which comprises of
          representatives from the public and private sector.

          sectors, moreover the third national state of environment report will
          be prepared based on these national environmental indicators.

          Jordan has implemented concrete steps towards transition to green
          economy that is both environmentally sustainable and socially
          inclusive. In 2017, Jordan developed it’s national Green Growth plan
          (NGGP) as a roadmap towards the transition, focusing on six sectors
          energy, water, waste over agriculture, tourism and transport Not that
          that in 2020, the green gross national action plan (GGNAP) was
          developed covering the six sectors, with a total number of 86 actions,

          Stemming from its national role to protect and sustain the
          environment, and based on the Environmental Protection Law, the
          Ministry of Environment has been, since its inception, devising
          environmental plans, strategies and legislation, in close cooperation
          and partnership with partners and stakeholders from the private and
          public sectors as well as civil society institutions. Also, the
          ministry has adopted global environmental frameworks and policies and
          ratified several international environmental agreements in its
          capacity as the national focal point. Acting upon national and
          international legal frameworks, the ministry continues to strengthen
          cooperation with national and international partners to ensure the
          delivery of projects and programs that support its strategy aimed at
          protecting Jordan's environmental resources and ensuring their
          sustainability. In this context, the ministry has signed a wide range
          of agreements and memoranda of understanding for cooperation with Arab
          and foreign countries6 .

          The main pressing environmental issues facing the country is the
          pressure on its water resources, which are falling well below
          international indicators of severe water scarcity, pressuring the
          country into withdrawing its water resources at unsustainable rates 8
          . Additionally, Jordan’s rapid population growth and increasing
          urbanization, refuge fluxes from neighboring countries, continue to
          put pressures on the country’s infrastructure and natural resources in
          ways that may create obstacles in the face of attempts towards
          environmental sustainability.
